### First Task: Calculator
It's a CLI Calculator run on the terminal (or any other code editor) for performing 6 basic arithmetic operations. These 6 basic arithmetic operations are-- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Integer Division & Modular Division (which outputs the remainder). There's also an exit feature which will take the user out of the forever-looping calculator. 

### Second Task: Password Generator
This is another terminal program which helps the user generate a password of any length (>0). It also gives the user a choice to choose whether to generate a weak password or strong password. It even warns the user if there password is too short or weak, but if they choose it anyway then it does the job. 

### Third Task: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This is a fairly interactive terminal interfaced Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
